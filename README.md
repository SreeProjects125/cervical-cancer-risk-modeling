# cervical-cancer-risk-modeling
Cervical Cancer datset, cleans and prepares the data, trains an interpretable machine learning model, evaluates its performance on unseen data, and analyzes results with a focus on transparency and limitations.
Research and educational modeling only
After training, the model generates predictions using the testing dataset.
These predictions simulate how the model would behave on new, unseen data.
Training set – used to train the model
Testing set – used to evaluate performance
